## \u2699\ufe0f WORKFLOW AND COMMUNICATION RULES

1. Each agent works in its own branch (e.g., `agent/backend`, `agent/frontend`).  
2. Agents open pull requests with descriptive summaries and checklists.  
3. All agents report progress via `STATUS.md`.  
4. On PR merge, related issue(s) auto-close using \u201cCloses #X\u201d syntax.  
5. `main` branch always remains stable and deployable.  
6. Every task references documentation in `/docs/` and uses consistent naming conventions.

---

## \U0001f9ed VERSIONING & CONTINUITY

- Versioning follows **Semantic Versioning (SemVer)**.  
- For new features, agents must append changelog entries in `/CHANGELOG.md`.  
- Documentation must always reflect deployed version.

## \U0001fa84 NEXT STEPS

1. Place this file as `AGENTS.md` at repo root.  
2. Create a `TASKS_CHECKLIST.md` (based on phases above).  
3. Use your script or `githubcsvtools` to convert checklist into issues.  
   Example:
   ```bash
   python githubcsvtools markdown_to_csv.py TASKS_CHECKLIST.md issues.csv
   githubcsvtools create-issues --repo mateo-bolanos/school-management --csv issues.csv
